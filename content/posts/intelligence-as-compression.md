title = 'Intelligence as Compression'
+++

The squishy thinking organism we carried around is the accumulation of human evolution packaging knowledge and experience for thousands of years. After you are born, you do not learn to talk after 2 or 3 years. You had already been learning to talk for thousands of years. It is the beauty of how intelligence can be compressed, transferred and mutated. This begs the question, "how did it do it?"

One observation is the brain itself has a special compression representation, much like vector embeddings. After all, machine is trying to mimic the learning process, coincedently, very similar to how brain works - compressing lots of data into embedding vector space.
