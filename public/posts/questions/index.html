   <meta name="description" content="How can we help children learn to think better?
The world has changed, but the education system has not. Lagging behind the evolution renders traditional school no more than a deadweight. Everybody is worrying about AI taking our jobs, just like the industrial revolution taking farmers&rsquo; jobs. It is bound to happen and it is a good thing.
But in fact, what we should worry about is get the generation ready for that. And to prepare for that, it is not to hit our kids when they got F on report card, it is not to force them to memorize searchable facts, it is not to compare them and put them in ranks like product ranking, and clearly not just put kids sitting down the whole day listening to list of boring facts. You are wasting your kids time, and eventually destroying their life. What you need to do is to teach them how to think, how to be creative, and how to be nice. These are what robots cannot do.">
